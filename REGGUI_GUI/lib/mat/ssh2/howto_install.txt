For easy use of ssh from anywhere in Matlab, it is advised to add the ssh2 JAVA library to the Matlab static path.

To add files to the static path, create a javaclasspath.txt file:

1. Create an ASCII text file and name the file javaclasspath.txt in your Matlab preference folder.
This preference folder location can be found with the command prefdir

2. In this file, simply enter the name of a Java class folder or jar file, one per line. In my case:
D:\reggui\lib\ssh\ganymed-ssh2-build250\ganymed-ssh2-build250.jar

3. Restart Matlab.


Any help to avoid this procedure and enable the use of dynamic path is welcome.
