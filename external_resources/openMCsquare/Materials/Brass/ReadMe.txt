Typically, Brass is CuZn39Pb3. The technical data can be found in https://www.euralliage.com/cw614n.htm

Element	Cu	Pb	Zn	Density  g/cm3

The stopping power were generated in Geant4 with the complete composition of Brass
The Radiation_Length is also computed iwth the complete composition of Brass. This should give a better estimation of the scattering compare to copper only.

However, the nuclear cross-section for Zn is not available in ICRU. Therefore Zn was removed from the elemental composition. The 40.5% of the Zinc are "redistributed" to Cu (96%) a,d Pb (4%).
